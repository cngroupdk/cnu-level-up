# CNU Level 2: Basics of JavaScript, HTML, CSS

In this level you will get familiar with **Holy Trinity of web development**:

- [JavaScript](./JavaScript/)
- [HTML](./HTML/)
- [CSS](./CSS/)

These 3 quests are not mutually connected and you can start with any of them. In each folder you find the `README.md` file with the theory you would need to successfully solved the exercises at the end of the topic.

During your first week in CN you will be assigned small homeworks to improve your technical skills. We will meet each morning to discuss your solutions. The exercises could be found at the end of each topic or in the list below:

## “Stand-up”

As mentioned before you and your mentors gonna have a meeting every single day, so-called `stand-ups`. In otder to make it as close to a regular stand-up as possible at least once or twice per week the standup will be in english.

**What can you expect?**

- discussing your questions
- demoing your status
- code-review with focus on code quality
- all questions should be prepared for the stand-up

## Learning = making mistakes

We want to say this loud and clear, learning programming is a process of making mistakes and learning from them. Do NOT get discouraged when you can't solve a challenge.

No programmer learned programming without making every single mistake that you will make. This is not motivational, this is a FACT.

> **One more tip:** you cannot learn programming in 1 day or 1 week. In fact, sleep is an important process in learning programming as it helps you persist the knowledge that you acquired.
