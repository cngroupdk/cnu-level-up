## Learning = making mistakes

We want to say this loud and clear, learning programming is a process of making mistakes and learning from them. Do NOT get discouraged when you can't solve a challenge.

No programmer learned programming without making every single mistake that you will make. This is not motivational, this is a FACT.

> **One more tip:** you cannot learn programming in 1 day or 1 week. In fact, sleep is an important process in learning programming as it helps you persist the knowledge that you acquired.
