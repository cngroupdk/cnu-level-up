# CNU Level 3: Git

`Git` is the most popular version control tool — something that developers use to save all relevant versions of their work. It also makes it easy for developers to collaborate and share work with others!

## Git workflows

A Git workflow is a recipe or recommendation for how to use Git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner.

When evaluating a workflow for your team, it's most important that you consider your team’s culture. You want the workflow to enhance the effectiveness of your team and not be a burden that limits productivity. Some things to consider when evaluating a Git workflow are:

- Does this workflow scale with team size?
- Is it easy to undo mistakes and errors with this workflow?
- Does this workflow impose any new unnecessary cognitive overhead to the team?
